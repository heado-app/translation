  short: Heado, the heat calendar for all your dogs!
  long: "Heado offers you a simple and clear calendar about your heat of your dog.\n
    \n<b>🔄 Current heat 🔄</b>\n\nDirectly on the home page you can see in which phase
    your dog is. The simple illustration shows you how long the current cycle phase
    will last. All previous cycles of your dog are used for the calculation.\n\n<b>✨
    Prediction of the next heat ✨</b>.\n\nThe Heado app tells you when your pet will
    have the next heat. This makes it much easier to plan your vacation, doggy daycare
    stay and even a visit to your parents. The \ncalculation of the next heat is based
    on the previous cycles of your dog.\n\n<b>😇 Mood of your dog 😇</b>\n\nKeep a daily
    record of your dog's mood. As with humans, your dog's hormone balance is greatly
    altered with each cycle. This can result in different moods in your dog before,
    during or after heat. Use Heado and document your dog's moods. It will help you
    understand your pet better and in the long run you will be able to tell if your
    female is getting cuddly or anxious before her cycle. \n\n<b>🩸 Consistency of
    the discharge 🩸</b>.\n\nThe consistency of the discharge is an important component
    during heat. Similar to period calendars for women, you can document the characteristics
    of your dog's discharge. This data will help you detect unusual secretions and
    keep an eye on your pet's health.\n\n<b>ℹ️ Tips & information on heat ℹ️</b>\n
    \nWith Heado you have a faithful companion on the subject of heat of the dog lady.
    You will find in the app all the necessary information about the cycle of your
    dog. You are missing a topic or you have a question? Contact me at wuff@heado.app
    and I will do my best to answer your question and add it to the app.\n\n<b>🐶 For
    all your dogs 🐶</b>\n\nYou have multiple dog females? Great! You can add as many
    dogs as you want in the Heado app. Easily switch between your pets, just like
    you know it from social media apps.\n\n<b>👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 For the whole family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧</b>\n
    \nPartner, dog sitter, kids? No problem! You can invite all household members
    to the app, and together keep track of the heat. Each family member has access
    to all data and can add the necessary information.\n\n<b>🐾 From dog owners for
    dog owners 🐾</b>\n\nI (Fabian) as the developer of the app, have a dog myself.
    Together with my partner, we designed Heado, because we ourselves saw the need
    for such a calendar. Of course every dog is different and also every family member
    has its own requirements. Feel free to contact me with your feedback & wishes
    for the app. By mail: wuff@heado.app or here in the reviews.\n\n<b>💰 Free with
    advertising 💰</b>.\n\nIdeally, Heado is free and ad-free. However, it's not that
    simple. A project like Heado costs a lot of money and a lot of time. In order
    for the project to be sustainable, I run ads. If you don't want to see ads, you
    can buy the ad-free premium version for a one-time payment. If you use Heado together
    with your family, you can also buy a cheap family package, and all members can
    use the app ad-free.\n\n<b>🇩🇪 data protection made in Germany 🇩🇪</b>\n\nHeado
    is a German project. The development and the servers are located in Germany. I
    have kept the use of third party vendors to a minimum. The app asks you for your
    data processing preferences before use. Heado is therefore DSGVO compliant."
