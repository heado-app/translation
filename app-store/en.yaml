description: "Heado offers you a simple and clear calendar about your heat of your
  dog.\n\n* Current heat *\n\nDirectly on the home page you can see in which phase
  your dog is. The simple illustration shows you how long the current cycle phase
  will last. All previous cycles of your dog are used for the calculation.\n\n* Prediction
  of the next heat *\n\nThe Heado app tells you when your pet will have the next heat.
  This makes it much easier to plan your vacation, doggy daycare stay and even a visit
  to your parents. The \ncalculation of the next heat is based on the previous cycles
  of your dog.\n\n* Mood of your dog *\n\nKeep a daily record of your dog's mood.
  As with humans, your dog's hormone balance is greatly altered with each cycle. This
  can result in different moods in your dog before, during or after heat. Use Heado
  and document your dog's moods. It will help you understand your pet better and in
  the long run you will be able to tell if your female is getting cuddly or anxious
  before her cycle. \n\n* Consistency of the discharge *\n\nThe consistency of the
  discharge is an important component during heat. Similar to period calendars for
  women, you can document the characteristics of your dog's discharge. This data will
  help you detect unusual secretions and keep an eye on your pet's health.\n\n* Tips
  & information on heat *\n\nWith Heado you have a faithful companion on the subject
  of heat of the dog lady. You will find in the app all the necessary information
  about the cycle of your dog. You are missing a topic or you have a question? Contact
  me at wuff@heado.app and I will do my best to answer your question and add it to
  the app.\n\n* For all your dogs *\n\nYou have multiple dog females? Great! You can
  add as many dogs as you want in the Heado app. Easily switch between your pets,
  just like you know it from social media apps.\n\n* For the whole family *\n\nPartner,
  dog sitter, kids? No problem! You can invite all household members to the app, and
  together keep track of the heat. Each family member has access to all data and can
  add the necessary information.\n\n* From dog owners for dog owners *\n\nI (Fabian)
  as the developer of the app, have a dog myself. Together with my partner, we designed
  Heado, because we ourselves saw the need for such a calendar. Of course every dog
  is different and also every family member has its own requirements. Feel free to
  contact me with your feedback & wishes for the app. By mail: wuff@heado.app or here
  in the reviews.\n\n* Free with advertising *\n\nIdeally, Heado is free and ad-free.
  However, it's not that simple. A project like Heado costs a lot of money and a lot
  of time. In order for the project to be sustainable, I run ads. If you don't want
  to see ads, you can buy the ad-free premium version for a one-time payment. If you
  use Heado together with your family, you can also buy a cheap family package, and
  all members can use the app ad-free.\n\n* data protection made in Germany *\n\n
  Heado is a German project. The development and the servers are located in Germany.
  I have kept the use of third party vendors to a minimum. The app asks you for your
  data processing preferences before use. Heado is therefore DSGVO compliant."
