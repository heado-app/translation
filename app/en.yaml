  mayo: "Hey fur nose! 🐾\n\nNice that you've found your way to my secret area! Maybe
    you already know me. If not, my name is Mayo and I'm an Appenzell mountain dog.
    A female, of course! I am now 2 years old. The illustration above is me. Just
    so you can recognize me if you ever see me.\n\nUnfortunately, my family and I
    had to realize that I always have anxious phases. At some point, we all thought
    that my hormones were going crazy before my heat and that's why I wasn't as brave
    anymore. But we weren't quite sure.\n\nMy owner Korinna then had the idea that
    you could make a calendar for female dogs, just like for human females. No sooner
    said than done! My master Fabian is a programmer. He also thought it was a great
    idea and got started straight away.\n\nBut Fabian soon realized that he had no
    idea whatsoever about a dog's cycle. Or what it involves. So he did a lot of research
    on the internet, asked Korinna a lot of questions and compared it with existing
    apps for human ladies.\n\nAfter a few months and a test phase with my paw friends,
    the time had come! On 27.11.2023 we published Heado in the App Store for Android
    & iOS.\n\nIn fact, my anxiety phases come from my hormones. But it seems to get
    much better with every heat. We'll definitely keep an eye on it.\n\nI hope we
    can also help you and your humans with this app and find problems or irregularities
    more quickly. And also have the necessary evidence at the vet.\n\nIf you or your
    humans have any ideas or requests, please contact me at mayo@heado.app. Also in
    case of problems, errors or difficulties.\n\nHave fun with the app! <3\n\nMayo,
    Korinna & Fabian"
